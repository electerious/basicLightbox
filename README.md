- Simple JS API

## Requirements

basicLightbox depends on the following browser features and APIs:

- [classList](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-element-classlist)
- [Pointer Events](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/)
- [Flexible Box Layout Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/)
- [Object.assign](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-object.assign)
- [requestAnimationFrame](https://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/#dom-windowanimationtiming-requestanimationframe)

Some of these APIs are capable of being polyfilled in older browsers. Check the linked resources above to determine if you must polyfill to achieve your desired level of browser support.

## Setup

We recommend to install basicLightbox using [Bower](https://bower.io/) or [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
bower install basicLightbox
```

```sh
npm install basiclightbox
```

Include the CSS file in the `head` tag and the JS file at the end of your `body` tag…

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/basicLightbox.min.css">
```

```html
<script src="dist/basicLightbox.min.js"></script>
```

…or skip the JS file and use basicLightbox as a module:

```js
const basicLightbox = require('basiclightbox')
```

## API

### .create(html, opts)

Creates a new basicLightbox instance. `html` can be provided either as html string or a Node object.
(The same applies to `opts.beforePlaceholder` and `opts.afterPlaceholder`.)

Be sure to assign the returned instance to a variable. Using your instance, you can…

* …show and close the lightbox.
* …check if the the lightbox is visible.
* …modify the content of the lightbox.

Examples:

```js
const instance = basicLightbox.create(`
	<h1>Dynamic Content</h1>
	<p>You can set the content of the lightbox with JS.</p>
`)
```

```js
const instance = basicLightbox.create(`
	<h1>Not closable</h1>
	<p>It's not possible to close this lightbox with a click.</p>
`, {
	closable: false
})
```

Parameters:

- `html` `{String}` Content of the lightbox.
- `opts` `{?Object}` An object of [options](#options).

Returns:

- `{Object}` The created instance.

### .visible()

Returns `true` when a lightbox is visible. Also returns `true` when a lightbox is currently in the process of showing/hiding and not fully visible/hidden, yet.

Example:

```js
const visible = basicLightbox.visible()
```

Returns:

- `{Boolean}` Visibility of any lightbox.

## Instance API

Each basicLightbox instance has a handful of handy functions. Below are all of them along with a short description.

### .show(cb)

Shows a lightbox instance.

Examples:

```js
instance.show()
```

```js
instance.show(() => console.log('lightbox now visible'))
```

Parameters:

- `cb(instance)` `{?Function}` A function that gets executed as soon as the lightbox starts to fade in.

### .close(cb)

Closes a lightbox instance.

Examples:

```js
instance.close()
```

```js
instance.close(() => console.log('lightbox not visible anymore'))
```

Parameters:

- `cb(instance)` `{?Function}` A function that gets executed as soon as the lightbox has been faded out.

### .visible()

Returns `true` when the lightbox instance is visible. Also returns `true` when the lightbox is currently in the process of showing/hiding and not fully visible/hidden, yet.

Example:

```js
const visible = instance.visible()
```

Returns:

- `{Boolean}` Visibility of lightbox.

### .element()

Returns the Node object associated with the instance.

Example:

```js
const elem = instance.element()
```

Returns:

- `{Node}` Node object associated with the instance.

## Options

The option object can include the following properties:

```js
{
	/*
	 * Prevents the lightbox from closing when clicking its background.
	 */
	closable: true,
	/*
	 * One or more space separated classes to be added to the basicLightbox element.
	 * Must be a string or a function which returns a string.
	 */
	className: null,
	/*
	 * Callback functions.
	 * Returning false will stop the caller function and prevent the lightbox from showing or closing.
	 */
	beforeShow: (instance) => {},
	afterShow: (instance) => {},
	beforeClose: (instance) => {},
	afterClose: (instance) => {},
	/*
	 * String containing HTML or function which returns a string of HTML.
	 * Will be added before or after the content placeholder of the lightbox.
	 */
	beforePlaceholder: '',
	afterPlaceholder: ''
}
```

Import `src/styles/main.scss` directly to customize the look of basicLightbox:

```scss
$basicLightbox__background: rgba(0, 0, 0, .8); // Background color
$basicLightbox__zIndex: 1000; // Stack order
$basicLightbox__duration: .4s; // Transition duration
$basicLightbox__timing: ease; // Transition timing

@import 'src/styles/main';
```
